# mastermind

This project was started with my daughter McKennah on July 6th, 2018. She recieved the game Mastermind for her birthday. I asked if she was interested in creating a code based version of the game with me. We are working together to help her learn the basics of coding in python as well as general logic, variable and process concepts.
